Please change the following and show it to the lab assistant during  the lab before starting the implementation: 

EER:
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX- many of the cardinalities are not correct, revise them
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX- Airport entity is needed 
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX- A weak entity for the Route Price is needed since it changes every year
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX- Separate entities are needed for yearlyProfit and weekdayProfit
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX- Weekly Schedule should be a weak entity
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX- flight.profit, reservation.passengers should be removed
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX- booked_passengers should be between reservation and passenger not between reservation and booking as the passengers are filled in before the booking is paid-
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX- booked_passengers should have ticket nummber and is M:N
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX- booked.bookid should be removed
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX- booked is not a weak entity and contains total price which can't be derived

Translation:
- since booking is a subclass of reservation, booking.id is a PK in booking and at the same time FK to reservation
- change after updating the diagram
