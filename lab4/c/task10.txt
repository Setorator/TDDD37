A: No. MySQL locks the resources used when doing changes to a table. 
   For us only one was able to complete at all, the other terminal
   froze.

B: If we do not use transactions it is possible to overbookings to 
   occur since we have no locking of the tables while bookings are
   made. Example: two bookings run at almost the same time and the 
   first one finish after that the last safety-check (in the 
   addPayment()-procedure). Then the last booking execution will
   finish without errors as well.

C: We proved our thesis. We managed to overbook by implementing the
   sleep(5) right after the passing of the fail-safes in our 
   addPayment()-procedure.

D: Our solution is to lock all relevant tables by referring to the 
   allFlights view and the credit_card table. This solves our problem
   since no other user could book whie the resources are locked by
   another process.
