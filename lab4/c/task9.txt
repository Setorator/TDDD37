A: Done

B: No because transaction A has not yet commited.  

C: We can not do it since A has not yet commited. 
   The only way B can access the reservations from A
   is if A has commited (i.e. updated) the database and 
   B has ended its current transaction and started a 
   new one. This is because B is working with the state 
   of the database when starting the transaction, this
   is the concept of isolation of transactions.
