Task 8a:
   One way to protect the credit card information could be to encrypt the
   information we want to protect. Once information is stored it is protected
   by an encryption function and once information is accessed a decryption
   function is used.
   Another way could be to only grant access of the credit card information to
   specific admins with personal passcodes. In other words, anyone can add new
   credit card information but to access it and retrieve it you have to be an
   admin and enter your personal passcodes.

Task 8b:
   1. The usage of stored procedures MIGHT improve the performance of a server-
   client system since less information/operations need to be transfered between
   the two. As long as the amount of clients connected to the server is low
   enough or that the server can handle a large amount of clients.
   2. It gives the user a simpler view of the database since there are pre-
   defined functions/procedures that can be used.
   3. Say that there is multiple client applications who want to use the same
   operations on the database and say that these clients are written in
   different programming languages. This would mean that all the clients would
   need to implement the same operations but in their own programming language.
   4. Stored procedures is also good in order to maintain a good security since
   the users have no access to the "inside operations" of the database and is
   only allowed to see what the database wants them to see.
