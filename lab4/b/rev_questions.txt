Further changes needed before the implementation (I will be now in my room until 15:30):

! Booked is subclass of reservation thus reservation id is a PK in Booked and a FK to reservation.
# Fixed

! The relationship ticket nr between Passenger and Booked should be removed as
  the information is derived through a join between Booked, Reservation and reserved pass.
# Fixed


! The ticket number attribute from Booked should be moved to the reserved pass relationship.  
# Fixed

! WeeklySchedule:Flight is 1:M not the other way
? Why?
A We thought this but wrote the opposit 
# Fixed

! Flight (not WeeklySchedule) is connected to Reservation.
? Why?, What is WeeklySchedule and what is flight?
# Fixed

! Plane:Flight 1:M
# Fixed

! In Weekday PK consists of (year, day)
? Why year, should weekday have a relation to year then?

! The translation needs to be updated after the changes.
