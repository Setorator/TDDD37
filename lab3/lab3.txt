------- Task 1 ------- 
----------------------


a)

1NF: no non-atomic values, i.e. no multivalued values.
2NF: no non-prime attributes that are functionally dependent on a PART of a candidate key.

Relation: R={A,B,C,D}
Primary key: A

FD1: {A} -> {C}
FD2: {A,B} -> {D}

Here we have the candidate keys {A,B} and since C is functional dependent on ONLY A we are 
not in 2NF.


b)

3NF: no non-prime attributes that is functionaly dependent on attributes that is NOT a 
super key.

Relation: R={A,B,C,D}
Primary key: A

FD1: {A} -> {B}
FD2: {B} -> {C}
FD3: {C} -> {D}

Here we have the super key {A} and since both FD2 and FD3 are not dependent on A we are 
violating the criterias for 3NF.


c)

BCNF: for every X -> Y on R we have that X is a superkey.

Relation: R={A,B,C,D}
Primary key: A

FD1: {A,B} -> {C,D}
FD2: {C} -> {B}

This example is taken from lecture 5. Both {A,B} and {A,C} is candidate keys but FD2 
violates the criterion for BCNF since {C} by itself is not a candidate key.

----------------------
------- Task 2 ------- 
----------------------

a)

Relation: R={A,B,C,D,E,F}

FD1: {A,B} -> {C}
FD2: {A} -> {D}
FD3: {D} -> {A,E}
FD4: {E} -> {F}

------- For candidate key {A,B} -------
Transitivity rule FD2, FD3:
FD5: {A} -> {A,E}

Decomposition rule FD5:
FD6: {A} -> {E} ({A} -> {A} is redundant)

Transitivity rule FD6 FD4:
FD7: {A} -> {F}

Union rule FD2, FD6, FD7:
FD8: {A} -> {D,E,F}

Augmentation rule FD8:
FD9: {A,B} -> {B,D,E,F,}

Union rule FD1, FD9:
FD10: {A,B} -> {B,C,D,E,F}

------- For candidate key {B,D} -------
Decomposition rule FD3:
FD11: {D} -> {A}
FD12: {D} -> {E}

Transitivity rule FD12,FD4:
FD13: {D} -> {F}

Union rule FD11, FD12, FD13:
FD14: {D} -> {A,E,F}

Augmentation rule FD14:
FD15: {D,B} -> {A,B,E,F}

Psedo-transitivity rule FD11, FD1:
FD16: {D,B} -> {C}

Union rule FD15, FD16:
FD17: {B,D} -> {A,B,C,D,E,F}

------- Conlcusion and PK -------

This concludes that {A,B} and {B,D} is a canidate key and we choose {?,?}
to be our primary key.
Look for all potiential ways that an attribute/part
of an canidatekey could determin a non-prime attribute/attributes
example: can {A} -> {E,F}, yes becouse FD8 with Decomposition rule
gives {A} -> {E,F}

{A,B}-candidate key is PK


====================== 2NF task 2b ======================

FD8 together with decomposition rule violates the 2NF criterion therefore we split R in two.

Relation: R={A,B,C,D,E,F}
FD1: {A,B} -> {C}
FD2: {A} -> {D}
FD3: {D} -> {A,E}
FD4: {E} -> {F}

========= R1 =========
R1 = {A,E,F}
FD1: {A} -> {E,F}
FD2: {E} -> {F}

Candidate keys: {A}
======================

========= R2 =========
R2 = {A,B,C,D}
FD1: {A,B} -> {C}
FD2: {B,D} -> {C}
FD3: {A} -> {D}
FD4: {D} -> {A}

Augmentation Rule FD3:
FD5: {A,B} -> {B,D}
Union rule FD1, FD5:
FD6: {A,B} -> {B,C,D}

Augmentation Rule FD4:
FD7: {B,D} -> {A,B}
Union rule FD1, FD7:
FD6: {B,D} -> {A,B,C}

Candidate keys: {A,B}, {B,D}
======================

Our new tables are R1, R2 which is all in 2NF


====================== 3NF task 2c ======================

FD1 in R1 violates the 3NF criterion therefore we split R1 in two

R1 = {A,E,F}
FD1: {A} -> {E,F}
FD2: {E} -> {F}

========= R3 =========
R3 = {E,F}
FD1: {E} -> {F}

Candidate keys: {E}
======================

========= R4 =========
R4 = {A,E}
FD1: {A} -> {E}

Candidate keys: {A}
======================

Our new tables are R1, R3, R4 which is all in 3NF


====================== BCNF task 2d ======================

R2 = {A,B,C,D}
FD1: {A,B} -> {C}
FD2: {B,D} -> {C}
FD3: {A} -> {D}
FD4: {D} -> {A}

FD3 in R2 violates the BCNF criterion therefore we split R2 in two

========= R5 =========
R5 = {A,D}
FD1: {A} -> {D}

Candidate keys: {A}
======================

========= R6 =========
R6 = {A,B,C}
FD1: {A,B} -> {C}

Candidate keys: {A,B}
======================

Our new and final tables are R1, R3, R4, R5, R6
