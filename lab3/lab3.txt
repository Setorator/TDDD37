------- Task 1 ------- 
----------------------


a)

1NF: no non-atomic values, i.e. no multivalued values.
2NF: no non-prime attributes that are functionally dependent on a PART of a candidate key.

Relation: R={A,B,C,D}
Primary key: A

FD1: {A} -> {C}
FD2: {A,B} -> {D}

Here we have the candidate keys {A,B} and since C is functional dependent on ONLY A we are 
not in 2NF.


b)

3NF: no non-prime attributes that is functionaly dependent on attributes that is NOT a 
super key.

Relation: R={A,B,C,D}
Primary key: A

FD1: {A} -> {B}
FD2: {B} -> {C}
FD3: {C} -> {D}

Here we have the super key {A} and since both FD2 and FD3 are not dependent on A we are 
violating the criterias for 3NF.


c)

BCNF: for every X -> Y on R we have that X is a superkey.

Relation: R={A,B,C,D}
Primary key: A

FD1: {A,B} -> {C,D}
FD2: {C} -> {B}

This example is taken from lecture 5. Both {A,B} and {A,C} is candidate keys but FD2 
violates the criterium for BCNF since {C} by itself is not a candidate key.

------- Task 2 ------- 
----------------------

a)

Relation: R={A,B,C,D,E,F}

FD1: {A,B} -> {C}
FD2: {A} -> {D}
FD3: {D} -> {A,E}
FD4: {E} -> {F}

Transitivity rule FD2, FD3:
FD5: {A} -> {A,E}

Decomposition rule FD5:
FD6: {A} -> {E} ({A} -> {A} is redundant)

Transitivity rule FD6 FD4:
FD7: {A} -> {F}

Union rule FD2, FD6, FD7:
FD8: {A} -> {D,E,F}

Augmentation rule FD8:
FD9: {A,B} -> {B,D,E,F,}

Union rule FD1, FD9:
FD10: {A,B} -> {B,C,D,E,F}

This concludes that {A,B} is our only canidate key and we therefore the candidate 
key is our primary key. 


b)

BD-candidate key

Relation: R={A,B,C,D,E,F}

FD1: {A,B} -> {C}
FD2: {A} -> {D}
FD3: {D} -> {A,E}
FD4: {E} -> {F}



R1: R={B,C,D}
with
FD1: {A,B} -> {C}
With the new candidate key {A,B}.

R2: R={A,D,E,F}
with
FD1: {A} -> {D}
FD2: {D} -> {A,E}
With the new candidate key {E}.



c)
